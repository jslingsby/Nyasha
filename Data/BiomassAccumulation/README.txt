Median posterior values for fitted recovery parameters as explained in
chapter four of the included document (WilsonAdam_Dissertation.pdf).

The parameters can be interpreted as follows: 
*  gamma (γ)  defines the asymptotic upper limit of the curve
    (assuming constant alpha) and thus represents the potential
    maximum NDVI of the pixel (given enough time to recover after
    fire)
* lambda (λ) is the exponential term that describes the recovery rate
* A describes the amplitude of the sine wave and reflects the
    magnitude of the seasonality in that location. 
* ages are the estimated times to recovery, age = λ × log (0.005/γ).
